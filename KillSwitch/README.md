KillSwitch is an OSx application to disable internet connection when IP of the computer changes, i.e. VPN disconnects. 
It behaves like a kill switch mechanism on WiFi networks; asks the internet IP to an open source geolocator every 500 ms.

How to use?

- Start the app.
- Press start button when you want to keep the connection.

KillSwitch will check the IP twice every second and kill your WiFi if your IP changes.

Note: This application works only for disabling Wifi. It cannot disable the internet connection if ethernet is used.
